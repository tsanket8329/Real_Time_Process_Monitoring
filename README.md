# Real-Time Process Monitoring Dashboard

This repository contains our project for the CSE316 course at Lovely Professional University, submitted as part of Academic Task-2. Our team developed a Real-Time Process Monitoring Dashboard to track a computer’s CPU and memory usage in real-time, visualize the data through graphs, and issue alerts if usage exceeds safe thresholds. The project is implemented in Python and divided into three distinct modules, each handled by a team member. This tool is designed to help system administrators monitor system performance and identify potential issues quickly.

## Project Overview
The Real-Time Process Monitoring Dashboard is a Python-based application that provides live monitoring of system resources. It collects CPU and memory usage data every second for a specified duration (default: 60 seconds), displays the data in graphical form, and issues alerts if usage levels become critical. Key features include:
- **Real-Time Data Collection:** Gathers CPU and memory usage percentages every second.
- **Live Visualization:** Displays usage trends in graphs (CPU in blue, memory in red).
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Issues warnings if CPU or memory usage exceeds predefined thresholds, logs alerts, and calculates statistical metrics like averages, maximum, and minimum values.
- **Modular Design:** Split into three independent modules for better collaboration and maintainability.

## What It Does
- Collects CPU and memory usage data every second for 60 seconds (configurable duration).
- Visualizes the data in real-time using line graphs (CPU usage in blue, memory usage in red).
- Monitors usage levels and issues alerts:
  - CPU > 85%: “Alert: CPU usage is critically high.”
  - CPU > 50%: “Notice: CPU usage is moderately high.”
  - Memory > 80%: “Alert: Memory usage is critically high.”
  - Memory > 50%: “Notice: Memory usage is moderately high.”
- Calculates and displays average, maximum, and minimum CPU and memory usage.
- Logs all alerts and provides a summary at the end of the monitoring session.

## How to Run It
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your system:
1. **Install Python 3:**
   - Download and install Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
   - Ensure Python is added to your system’s PATH.
2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to install the necessary Python libraries:
  
3. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
- Clone this repository using Git:
- Or download the ZIP file from GitHub and extract it.
4. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
- Open a terminal and change to the project directory:
- 5. **Run the Project:**
- Execute the main script to start the monitoring dashboard:
- - The dashboard will start, showing live graphs and printing usage data and alerts.
6. **Stop the Program:**
- The program runs for 60 seconds by default.
- To stop it early, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into three modules, each responsible for a specific functionality. The files are organized as follows:
- **Data Collection (`data_collection.py`):**
- Handles the collection of CPU and memory usage data using the `psutil` library.
- Collects data every second and yields the timestamp, CPU percentage, and memory percentage.
- Includes error handling to manage potential failures in data collection.
- **Visualization (`visualization.py`):**
- Generates live graphs to visualize CPU and memory usage over time.
- Uses `matplotlib` to plot CPU usage in blue and memory usage in red.
- **Monitoring & Alerts (`monitoring_alerts.py`):**
- My contribution to the project.
- Monitors CPU and memory usage levels and issues alerts based on predefined thresholds.
- Calculates statistical metrics (average, maximum, minimum) for CPU and memory usage.
- Logs all alerts in a history list and provides a summary at the end of the session.
- Features include:
- Configurable thresholds (e.g., CPU critical at 80%, memory critical at 75%).
- Timestamped alert messages for better tracking.
- A reset function to clear alert history for new sessions.
- **Main Script (`main.py`):**
- Integrates all modules to run the dashboard.
- Calls `collect_data` to gather data, `draw_graphs` to visualize it, and `cpu_check`/`memory_check` to monitor and alert.

## Team Members and Contributions
Our team consists of three members, each responsible for one module:
- **Reg Number 12319490:** Developed the Data Collection module (`data_collection.py`).
- **Reg Number 12312303:** Developed the Visualization module (`visualization.py`).
- **Me (Reg Number 12314690):** Developed the Monitoring & Alerts module and Integrated Module (`monitoring_alerts.py`,`Integrated_code.py`).


## Technologies Used
We used the following tools and technologies to build this project:
- **Python 3:** The programming language for the entire project.
- **Libraries:**
- `psutil`: For collecting system resource usage (CPU and memory).
- `matplotlib`: For generating live graphs to visualize usage data.
- `numpy`: Included for potential numerical computations (though minimally used).
- `IPython.display`: For updating graphs in real-time.
- `time`: For managing delays and timestamps.
- **GitHub:** For version control and collaboration.
- We used branches (`data-collection`, `visualization`, `monitoring-alerts`) to work on our modules independently.
- All changes were merged into the `main` branch after development.

## Development Process
We followed a structured workflow to develop this project:
1. **Repository Setup:**
- Created a public repository on GitHub named `RealTimeProcessMonitoring`.
- Initialized it with a blank `README.md`.
2. **Module Development:**
- Each team member created a branch for their module:
- `data-collection` for Module 1.
- `visualization` for Module 2.
- `monitoring-alerts` for Module 3 (my part).
- Developed our modules independently, making multiple commits to show progress.
3. **Revisions:**
- Made at least 25+ commits across the project, as required by the assignment.
- For my module (`monitoring_alerts.py`), I made changes like adjusting thresholds, adding alert history, and enhancing the test block.
4. **Integration:**
- Merged all branches into `main` using pull requests.
- Updated `main.py` to ensure all modules work together seamlessly.
5. **Documentation:**
- Added this detailed `README.md` to explain the project, setup, and contributions.

## Notes
- The program runs for 60 seconds by default but can be configured to run for a different duration by modifying the `duration` parameter in `collect_data`.
- Alerts are issued at 80% for CPU and 75% for memory, with messages like “Alert: CPU usage is critically high.” I adjusted these thresholds from an initial 85% to make the alerts more practical.
- You can stop the program early by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
- The Monitoring & Alerts module logs all alerts and provides a summary at the end, showing up to 5 alerts (I reduced this from 10 to avoid clutter).

## Future Improvements
We have some ideas to enhance the project in the future:
- Add the ability to monitor and display running processes that are consuming the most resources.
- Implement email or desktop notifications for critical alerts.
- Extend the monitoring duration dynamically based on user input.
- Add a user interface (e.g., using Tkinter) to make the dashboard more interactive.
